    "description": "In this mini project, we're using a special computer program to make a 3D version of a camera bag. It's like taking a bunch of pictures and turning them into a 3D model! First, the program helps us find important points in the pictures automatically. Then, we make sure everything looks just right by adjusting things manually. Finally, we get a 3D version of the camera bag.",
